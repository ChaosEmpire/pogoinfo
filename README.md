# Pogo Information

Lots of up-to-date data for Pogo. Updated everyday at 9am GMT.

Go through the code and see if you find something useful.
- events/active.json is only good for event spawns. eggs/raids/quests are not really supported
- Most formats should be easy to understand. Note that Mon IDs are in the format of 3rd party icon repos. so `monid_formid_megaid`
